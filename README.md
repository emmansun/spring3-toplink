spring3-toplink
===============

Support for TopLink native APIs has been removed from Spring 3.0. The support provided in Spring Framework 2.5.x is for TopLink 9 and 10. The newer TopLink 11 has a modified API, which Spring does not support. If you use TopLink 9 or 10 and want to use Spring 3.0, we recommend that you migrate your code to TopLink or Eclipse Link JPA. But we had many old projects that still used native toplink APIs with toplink 10, And we also hope to migrate spring framework from 2.5.x to 3.2.x.
